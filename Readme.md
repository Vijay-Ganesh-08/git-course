# Git

- Centralized and Distributed Version Control System
- Single Code Repository used for Collaboration and Version Control
- Everyone in Development team is aligned/aware with the changes
- Local Repository - Local Machine contains git repository
- Remote Repository - GitHub site which can be used by team
- Staging Area - letting Git know to what files to track; any changes done to the files, we need to add that to staging area and then only we can commit. files which are un-staged can be committed directly but not recommended.
- Commit History - Tracking the changes in file for all commits, every commit will have an ID which helps for rollback and to track the changes applied to the file.
- Git can be cloned and pushed either by HTTPS (Login Creds) or SSH (Public/Private KeyPair)

- **git status** → to check the status of git repository
- **rm -rf .git** → to delete the folder of git from the project folder
- **git add FirstCode.txt** → to add the file to the staging area of git
- **git add .** → to add all the files to the staging area of git

- **git diff --staged** → to check the changes happened to a file which is added to staging area.
- **git clone XXXX.git** → to take a copy of code base from remote to local repository.
- **git branch -M main** → to mark the branch and MAIN
- **git remote add origin XXXXX.git** → to add the remote repository to the local repository
- **git push -u origin main →** to push the code from local repository to remote repository for the first time.
- **git push origin main** → to push the code from local repository to remote repository.
    - origin → Remote Repository URL
    - main → Branch Name to be pushed
- **git remote -v** → used to check the remote repositories (For Fetch and to Push)
- **git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1”** → to add a tag to the source code
    - v1.0 is the Tag name
    - Version 1 is the Tag Message
- **git push origin v1.0** → to push the tags to remote repository
- **git checkout -b feature1 or git switch -c feature1** → creates a new branch named feature1 and switches to this branch as working directory
- **git checkout main** or **git switch main** → switches the checkout branch to main
- **git branch** → list all the branches from local repository and * is prefixed for check-out branch
