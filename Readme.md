# Git

- Centralized and Distributed Version Control System
- Single Code Repository used for Collaboration and Version Control
- Everyone in Development team is aligned/aware with the changes
- Local Repository - Local Machine contains git repository
- Remote Repository - GitHub site which can be used by team
- Staging Area - letting Git know to what files to track; any changes done to the files, we need to add that to staging area and then only we can commit. files which are un-staged can be committed directly but not recommended.
- Commit History - Tracking the changes in file for all commits, every commit will have an ID which helps for rollback and to track the changes applied to the file.
- Git can be cloned and pushed either by HTTPS (Login Creds) or SSH (Public/Private KeyPair)
